        <ul>
            <li>
                <button class="question">You mentioned coffee?</button>
                <div class="answer hidden"><p>Correct! The Freeland Community Hall has allowed us use of their kitchen. We will be offering light refreshements in the form of coffee, tea, maybe juice or pop, and chips or popcorn.</p></div>

                <div class="answer hidden"><p>Daniel and Maggie. We are just people from the area, with too many board games and no one to play them with. This event is not connected to any organization. The Freeland Community Hall has offered this space, and we are hoping to attract people from in and around the Lot 11 community.</p></div>
            </li>
